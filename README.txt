Welcome to the Transform Tutorial!
Prerequesites: World Matrix (SRT optionally)

Rather than having translations, rotations, scaling,
and matrices in the entity class, we built a new Transform 
class to handle everything related to the world matrix.
Then, we put an object of the Transform class in the entity
class. By looking at the Transform class code, with the 
knowledge from previous tutorials, everything should be 
easy to understand without further explanation
